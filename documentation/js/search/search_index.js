Specific Information\nPrerendering the files for deployment\nRun npm run prerender ! Past Nicos bids you hello.\nAdding code to the project scaffold\nRun ng generate component path/to/component-name --module= to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nServing the site to GitHub Pages\nFrom the finalized main branch, run the ./update-gh-pages.sh command in your Git terminal.\nAdding content\nAdding a year of content\nCreate the file submodules/app-content-XXXX.module.ts.\nWithin it, write the following\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\nimport { SharedModule } from '../shared.module';\nimport { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [ ],\n  imports: [\n    CommonModule,\n    SharedModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [],\n  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]\n})\nexport class AppXXXXModule { }Create the file routing/app-sub-routes-XXXX.ts. Within it write the following:\nimport { authorList } from './../data/authors';\nimport { TAG_TALKS, TAG_INFOSEC, TAG_CONVENTION, TAG_COMMUNITY } from '../utils/tags';\nimport { Routes } from '@angular/router';\n\nexport const subroutesXXXX: Routes = [\n\n/** Example:\n * ```\n * export const subroutesXXXX: Routes = [\n *  {\n *    path: '',\n *    component: Component,\n *    data: {\n *      title: '',\n *      authors: [ authorList[\"authorName\"] ],\n *      description: '', // optional\n *      image_url: '', // optional\n *      tags: [ TAG_YYYY ]\n *    }\n *  }\n * ]\n * ```\n */\n];Then create the file routing/app-content-XXXX-routing.module.ts, and insert the followin within:\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\nimport { subroutesXXXX } from './app.sub-routes-XXXX';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(subroutesXXXX)],\n  exports: [RouterModule]\n})\nexport class PostsXXXXRoutingModule { }\nFinally, link it to the rest in app-routing.module.ts:\n\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  // ***\n  {\n    path: 'post/XXXX',\n    loadChildren: () => import('./routing/app-content-XXXX-routing.module').then(m => m.PostsXXXXRoutingModule)\n  },\n  // ***\n];\nDon't forget to update static.paths.txt, static.paths.ts, sitemap.xml and rss.xml.\nAdding a tag\nGo to utils/tags.ts and add a tag:\nexport const TAG_XXXX: Tag = { name: 'Random' }Then you simply need to reference it from the routing/app.sub-routes-XXXX.ts and update static.paths.txt, static.paths.ts, sitemap.xml and rss.xml and you'll be all set.\nAdding an article\nOne can add an article by using the following command:\nng g c content/posts/XXXX/random-unique-name --module=submodules/app-content-XXXXWithin, the HTML file, one must set write the following:\n // [edited] is optional.\n  Your content here.\n\nAnything can be entered in between the app-post tags.\nDon't forget to update static.paths.txt, static.paths.ts, sitemap.xml and rss.xml.\nAdding an author\nOne can add an author by editing the data/authors.ts file and adding the relevant fields to an author:\nexport const authorList: AuthorMap = {\n  /// ...

  <p>Your contributions will have to be evaluated by the website administrator, in order to validate that they are conform to our <a href='/code-of-conduct' target='_blank'>code of conduct</a> and in the general ethic of the community.

  <hr/>

  <p>But how to get there? Well, it is pretty easy! There are two options!</p>

  <h4>Option 1: You are comfortable with git, Angular, and TypeScript!</h4>

  <p>You may fork the GitHub repository located at <a href='https://github.com/digital-overdose/digital-overdose.github.io' target='_blank'>https://github.com/digital-overdose/digital-overdose.github.io</a>, bring about your article following the guidelines in your own repository, and open a pull request!</p>

  <h4>Option 2: You are uncomfortable / have never heard of these technologies!</h4>

  <p>(And that's perfectly fine)</p>

  <p>Please send an email to <a href="mailto://digitaloverdosecon+articles@gmail.com">digitaloverdosecon+articles@gmail.com</a> with the  information cited below. This protects both the author(s) of the article and the community by ensuring a level of traceability.</p>

  <p>If it is your first time posting with us, we would like to help readers know who wrote the article, and as such we would want you to provide us with some information as specified below.</p>

    <li>A short description of what you do (in life, for work, things like that).</li>
    <li>As many links to social media / blogs that you would want to promote.</li>
  </ul>

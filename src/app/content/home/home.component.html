    <p class="text-justify mb-2">Digital Overdose is a community focused around information security, cybersecurity, ethical hacking and tech in general, that aims to provide a space where anyone can join, discuss and interact on topics they are fond of.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">We are acutely aware that not everyone has had the opportunity to learn about some of the fundamentals and advanced notions of infosec, networking, OSINT and the very many domains that security professionals, practitioners or amateurs regularly delve in. This is why we have weekly tutoring sessions on such notions, usually hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/mrs_skelli" target="_blank"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Eden (Mrs. Skelli)</a> or sometimes <a href="https://twitter.com/AtomicNicos" target="_blank"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Nicolas (AtomicNicos)</a> on our Discord.</p>
    <p class="text-justify mb-0">We believe that everyone should be able to partake in these activities without feeling endagered, targeted, harassed among other things that are sadly all too common in tech. This is why we take great care in fostering a warm, welcoming and nurturing environment to all, which we maintain by adopting an extremely pro-active policy when it comes to abuse, unethical activities and the various isms/phobias (e.g.: racism, sexism, transphobia, among many others).</p>

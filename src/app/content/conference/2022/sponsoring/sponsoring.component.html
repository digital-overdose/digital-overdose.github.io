<h2>Sponsoring D.O. CON 2</h2>

<h5 class="mt-4 mb-0">How?</h5>
<h5 class="mt-0 mb-4">Fill this form, and follow the Eventbrite link in the introduction!</h5>
<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <app-social-button class="m-1 mt-auto"
    [text]="'Sponsorship Form'"
    [url]="'https://forms.gle/rHoCFq8iTq4Aoj2s8'"
    [faClass]="'fas fa-align-left'"
    [color]="'#F05537'"
    [border]='false'
    ></app-social-button>
</div>

<h5 class="mt-4">What is it all about?</h5>

<p>Our community is people-driven: there are a great number of people involved, from rookies to professionals, joining in from all around the globe.<br/>The same goes for our conference:</p>

<p class="mb-0">Is the conference about the speakers? Definitely.</p>
<p class="mb-0">Is it about the mentors? They get to see the fruits of their efforts.</p>
<p class="mb-0">Is it about the hosts and volunteers? A bit, it is very gratifying to see it grow.</p>
<p class="mb-0">Is it the attendees? They get to share the good moments with us.</p>

<h5 class="mt-4">You can help us make it better!</h5>

<p>In order to provide our speakers with well-deserved conference "swag" and its shipping, organizations can choose to sponsor the event at a flat rate of 250â‚¬, sent through EventBrite, an event ticket management platform.</p>

<p>In return:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your organization's logo will appear on the stream overlay, and on the resulting stream and recording of the conference, which will both be made publicly available on YouTube.</li>
  <li>Your organization's logo will appear on this page, in a new section dedicated to sponsors (which will appear above this section).</li>
  <li>Your organization's logo will appear on any conference "swag" (t-shirts or hoodies) that we will order for the speakers, mentors and other conference contributors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last year we got our speakers and volunteers some stickers and T-shirts. This year, we would like to do more! (such as sending more to the mentors)</p>

<h5 class="mt-4">Is this an elaborate rug-pull?</h5>

<p class="mb-1">No. Please observe last year's transparency report on how the sponsorship funds were used: <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qKyODSq011zCmi69ZWzJwsdVon5htfPxifI9HqOJg30" rel="noopener"><em class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></em> Transparency Report</a>.</p>

<p class="coc-mention text-left mt-0">Based on recent events, we will however be changing the source for stickers.</p>

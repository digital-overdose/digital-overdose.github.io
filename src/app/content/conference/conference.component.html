<h3>What's all of this about ?</h3>

<p>Digital Overdose is proud to announce that we are running an information security conference !</p>

<p>The catch? The only people able to speak there are so-called rookies. Rookies not necessarily in the sense that they are new to Information Security, but more specifically in the sense that they've never had the experience of talking at a conference previously!</p>

<p>With the number of conventions with rookie tracks that have been cancelled, focusing specifically on rookies lets them have all of the well-deserved limelight, and helps foster the next generation of representatives of the community.</p>

<p>Anyone else is of course free to attend.</p>

<p>So if you're free on the 17th and 18th of April (2021), then <a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NzVuYjVxM2dlOHM5YzB0aWRhOXQ4MGluYzMgNDhyN3UxN2U1NWlmdDE5azc4M2Jidmw4bDhAZw&tmsrc=48r7u17e55ift19k783bbvl8l8%40group.calendar.google.com"><i class="far fa-calendar"></i> save the date</a> !</p>

<h3>Are you interested ?</h3>

<p>So we've managed to pique your interest ? That's awesome !</p>

<p>We have some good news then!<br/>From now until <a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NmlsbnN0M2pndmoyMTRnazFyOTAydWlsdDIgNDhyN3UxN2U1NWlmdDE5azc4M2Jidmw4bDhAZw&tmsrc=48r7u17e55ift19k783bbvl8l8%40group.calendar.google.com"><i class="far fa-calendar"></i> March 7th 23:59 GMT+1</a>, you may submit a talk proposal to this address:
<a target="_blank" href="mailto://digitaloverdosecon+cfp@gmail.com">digitaloverdosecon+cfp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>To make it nice and simple, we're thinking of <strong>30 minute</strong> talks (25 minutes for the actual talk and 5 minutes for a Q&A).</p>

<p>As such, your proposal can be as simple as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A title</li>
  <li>The subject matter</li>
  <li>A short description</li>
  <li>Your name and twitter handle</li>
</ul>

<p>We will then forward the first three elements (and nothing more) to a blind panel, to make sure that everyone gets a fair shot at speaking !</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>Digital Overdose is proud to announce that we are running a free online conference!</p>

<p>What will be spoken about? Information Security, Cybersecurity, OSINT, DevOps, Tech in general... Everything is on the table.</p>

<p>The catch? The only people able to speak there are <strong>rookies</strong>. Rookies not necessarily in the sense that they are new to Information Security or any of the other domains we've cited, but more specifically in the sense that they've never had the experience of talking at a conference previously!</p>

<p>Sounds cool right? That's what we think too!</p>

<p>So if you're free on the 17th and 18th of April (2021), then <a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NzVuYjVxM2dlOHM5YzB0aWRhOXQ4MGluYzMgNDhyN3UxN2U1NWlmdDE5azc4M2Jidmw4bDhAZw&tmsrc=48r7u17e55ift19k783bbvl8l8%40group.calendar.google.com"><i class="far fa-calendar"></i> save the date</a>, and feel free to mark yourself as attending on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/digitaloverdoseconference-aka-d6765979218758115328/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i> LinkedIn Event page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="attendance">How much will it cost? / Attendance</h2>

<h3 id="introduction">What's all of this about?</h3>

<p>Digital Overdose is proud to announce that we are running a free online conference!</p>

<p>What will be spoken about? Information Security, Cybersecurity, OSINT, DevOps, Tech in general... Everything is on the table.</p>

<p>The catch? The only people able to speak there are <strong>rookies</strong>. Rookies not necessarily in the sense that they are new to Information Security, but more specifically in the sense that they've never had the experience of talking at a conference previously!</p>

<p>With the number of conventions with rookie tracks that have been cancelled, focusing specifically on rookies lets them have all of the well-deserved limelight, and helps foster the next generation of representatives of the community.</p>

<p>So if you're free on the 17th and 18th of April (2021), then <a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NzVuYjVxM2dlOHM5YzB0aWRhOXQ4MGluYzMgNDhyN3UxN2U1NWlmdDE5azc4M2Jidmw4bDhAZw&tmsrc=48r7u17e55ift19k783bbvl8l8%40group.calendar.google.com"><i class="far fa-calendar"></i> save the date</a> !</p>

<h3 id="attendance">How much will it cost? / Attendance</h3>

<p>The conference will be <strong>free</strong> for anyone to attend.</p>

<p>Approximately one month before the event, we will open an EventBrite where you can optionally acquire a ticket (for interest metrics only).</p>

<p>For more updates, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/d_overcon"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square"></i> Twitter</a> and <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/digitaloverdose"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-linkedin"></i> LinkedIn</a> and don't hesitate to share with your friends.</p>

<p>The stream of the conference will be publicly hosted on <a class="card-links" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvTW4Eyt8xNbMEkFEEvFMIQ"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-youtube"></i> our YouTube channel</a>, and if you miss a talk or a few, we will have the recordings up as fast as possible in the days following the event, with links to them on this page.</p>

<h3 id="cfp-details">Are you interested? / CFP Submission</h3>

<p>So we've managed to pique your interest? That's awesome!</p>

<p>We have some good news then!<br/>From now until <a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NmlsbnN0M2pndmoyMTRnazFyOTAydWlsdDIgNDhyN3UxN2U1NWlmdDE5azc4M2Jidmw4bDhAZw&tmsrc=48r7u17e55ift19k783bbvl8l8%40group.calendar.google.com"><i class="far fa-calendar"></i> March 7th 23:59 GMT+1</a>, you may submit a talk proposal to this address:
<a target="_blank" href="mailto://digitaloverdosecon+cfp@gmail.com">digitaloverdosecon+cfp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>To make it nice and simple, we're thinking of <strong>30 minute</strong> talks (25 minutes for the actual talk and 5 minutes for a Q&A).</p>

<div class="my-2 p-1 important">
<p>And in the interest of making thinking about it as painless as possible, your proposal can be as simple as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A title</li>
  <li>The subject matter</li>
  <li>A short description</li>
  <li>Your name and any social media you're willing to share with us.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>We will then forward the first three elements (and nothing more) to a blind panel, to make sure that everyone gets a fair shot at speaking for the first time!</p>

<hr/>

<h3 id="for-sponsors">For potential sponsors</h3>

<p>In order to provide our speakers with well-deserved conference "swag" and its shipping, organizations can choose to sponsor the event at a flat rate, in exchange for shoutouts during the conference and their logos appearing on the stream as well as potential wearable merchandise.</p>

<p>The use of this sponsorship money will be 100% to cover the costs of swag, and we will publish a detailed public notice for the sake transparency</p>

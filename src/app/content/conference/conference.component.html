<h3>What's all of this about?</h3>

<p>Digital Overdose is proud to announce that we are running an information security conference !</p>

<p>The catch? The only people able to speak there are so-called rookies. Rookies not necessarily in the sense that they are new to Information Security, but more specifically in the sense that they've never had the experience of talking at a conference previously!</p>

<p>With the number of conventions with rookie tracks that have been cancelled, focusing specifically on rookies lets them have all of the well-deserved limelight, and helps foster the next generation of representatives of the community.</p>

<p>Anyone else is of course free to attend.</p>

<p>So if you're free on the 17th and 18th of April (2021), then <a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NzVuYjVxM2dlOHM5YzB0aWRhOXQ4MGluYzMgNDhyN3UxN2U1NWlmdDE5azc4M2Jidmw4bDhAZw&tmsrc=48r7u17e55ift19k783bbvl8l8%40group.calendar.google.com"><i class="far fa-calendar"></i> save the date</a> !</p>

<h3>Are you interested?</h3>

<p>So we've managed to pique your interest? That's awesome!</p>

<p>We have some good news then!<br/>From now until <a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NmlsbnN0M2pndmoyMTRnazFyOTAydWlsdDIgNDhyN3UxN2U1NWlmdDE5azc4M2Jidmw4bDhAZw&tmsrc=48r7u17e55ift19k783bbvl8l8%40group.calendar.google.com"><i class="far fa-calendar"></i> March 7th 23:59 GMT+1</a>, you may submit a talk proposal to this address:
<a target="_blank" href="mailto://digitaloverdosecon+cfp@gmail.com">digitaloverdosecon+cfp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>To make it nice and simple, we're thinking of <strong>30 minute</strong> talks (25 minutes for the actual talk and 5 minutes for a Q&A).</p>

<p>As such, your proposal can be as simple as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A title</li>
  <li>The subject matter</li>
  <li>A short description</li>
  <li>Your name and twitter handle</li>
</ul>

<p>We will then forward the first three elements (and nothing more) to a blind panel, to make sure that everyone gets a fair shot at speaking!</p>

<h3>How can I attend?</h3>

<p>Approximately one month before the event, we will open an EventBrite where you may acquire a free ticket, which will help us gauge the interest in the event.</p>

<p>The stream of the conference will be publicly hosted on our YouTube channel, and if you miss a talk or a few, we will have the recordings up as fast as possible in the days following the event.</p>

<p>Through that same platform, organizations can sponsor the event at a flat rate, in exchange for shoutouts during the conference and their logos appearing on the stream as well as potential wearable merchandise. The money made from this sponsorship will go 100% into providing our speakers with well-deserved conference "swag" and shipping of said "swag".</p>
